*** What is Selenium.
Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.
It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at Thought Works.
Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.

*** Why we use Selenium for automation testing?
a. We can use any programming language like Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, C#, and so on to create the Selenium test scripts.
b. We can execute the selenium test script in many different operating system platforms that are Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.
c. Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc are used to implement the selenium test scripts.
d. The Selenium testing tool can be associated with other testing tools such as TestNG, Junit for managing the test cases, and generating test reports.
e. To achieve continuous testing, Selenium is integrated with Maven, Jenkins, and Docker testing tools.
